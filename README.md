## 📝 Project Overview
This project was developed for an educational event to engage participants in a hands-on cybersecurity investigation. Players act as digital forensic analysts to identify the culprit behind a sensitive customer database leak.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Cloud Architecture
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla).
* **Hosting & Security:** [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) (Ensuring high availability and DDoS protection).
* **CI/CD:** Automated deployments via **GitHub Actions** integration with Cloudflare.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Investigation Narrative
A sensitive database has been leaked from the sales department. The mission is to analyze digital evidence and suspects:
* **The Suspects:** Sami (Poor performance), Layla (New employee), and Majed (Hardworking, late-night logins).
* **Evidence Logs:** File access logs, Network traffic logs, and Performance reviews.
* **Key Learning Point:** Understanding the difference between a "Red Herring" (Majed’s late hours) and "Confirmatory Evidence" (Sami’s large file export and unknown device login).

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Interactive Storytelling:** Engaging UI to guide the user through the investigation.
- **Data-Driven Clues:** Users must compare timestamps and file sizes (e.g., 3.8 GB export).
- **Automated Deployment:** Implemented a modern DevOps workflow where every update to the repository is automatically deployed to the cloud.
